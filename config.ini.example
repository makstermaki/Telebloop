# Both shows will first have their episodes grouped into chunks with the given segment and chunk sizes. The chunks
# will then be played in order, alternating between shows. E.g. chunk 1 of This Show will play, then chunk 1 of That Show,
# and then chunk 2 of This Show... When the last chunk of a show has been reached, the application will loop back to
# the first chunk of the show, starting from the beginning. Thus, all shows on the same channel do not need to be of the
# same length
